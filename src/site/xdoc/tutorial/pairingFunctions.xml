                An application should first initialize a pairing object. This causes PBC to setup curves, groups and
                other mathematical miscellany. After that, elements can be initialized and manipulated for cryptographic
                operations.

                <br/>
                Parameters for various pairings are included with the PBC library distribution in the param
                subdirectory, and some are suitable for cryptographic use. Some programs in the gen subdirectory may be
                used to generate parameters (see Chapter 7, Bundled programs). Also, see the PBC website for many more
                pairing parameters.

                <br/>
                Pairings involve three groups of prime order. The PBC library calls them G1, G2, and GT, and calls the
                order r. The pairing is a bilinear map that takes two elements as input, one from G1 and one from G2,
                and outputs an element of GT.

                <br/>
                The elements of G2 are at least as long as G1; G1 is guaranteed to be the shorter of the two. Sometimes
                G1 and G2 are the same group (i.e. the pairing is symmetric) so their elements can be mixed freely. In
                this case the pairing_is_symmetric function returns 1.
