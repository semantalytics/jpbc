            <subsection name="Initializing Elements">
                <p>
                    You can obtain an instance of an Element starting from an algebraic structure, such as a particular
                    finite field or elliptic curve group, represented by the
                    Field
                    interface.

                    We use G1 and G2 to denote the input groups to the pairing, and GT for the output group. All have
                    order r, and Zr means the ring of integers modulo r. G1 is the smaller group (the group of points
                    over the base field). With symmetric pairings, G1 = G2.
