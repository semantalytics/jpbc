            <p>
            We currently do not have candidates for multilinear
            maps between groups with cryptographically hard problems. However, Garg,
            Gentry, and Halevi (henceforth GGH) suggest a concrete candidate for an
            <span class="em">approximation</span> of multilinear maps, named <span class="em">graded encoding systems</span>.
            With the GGH candidate, group elements have a randomized (and thus non-unique) representation
            dubbed <span class="em">encoding</span>. While it is possible to extract a unique
            <span class="em">canonical bistring</span>, it is not possible to perform further computations
            with this extracted bitstring. An encoding can be re-randomized (e.g., to hide
            the sequence of operations that were performed), but only at the cost of introducing an
            artificial <span class="em">noice</span> term in the encoding. Further operation
            on this group element cause the noise to grow; once this
            noise grows beyond a certain bound, encodings can no longer be worked with.

                JPBC provides an implementation of multilinear maps
                described by <span class="em">Coron, Lepoint, and Tibouchi</span> in the paper
                <a name="http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/183.pdf"><span class="em">Practical Multilinear Maps over the Integers</span></a>.
                They describe a different construction from the GGH one that works over the integers
                instead of ideal lattices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the CTL construction there are two sets of parameters:

                <p>
                    <span class="em">The System Parameters</span>:
                    They govern the security and the correctness of the multilinear map.
                    They must be set carefully to satisfy the constraints described by Coron et al
                    in their paper in Section 3.1.

                    <span class="em">The Public Parameters</span>:
                    contain the cryptographic material corresponding to
                    the multilinear map described by given system parameters.
