            <subsection name="Abstract">
                The only known construction of identity-based signatures that can be proven secure in the standard model
                is based on the approach of attaching certificates to non-identity-based signatures. This folklore
                construction method leads to schemes that are somewhat inefficient and leaves open the problem of
                finding more efficient direct constructions. We present the first such construction. Our scheme is
                obtained from a modification of Waters’ recently proposed identity-based encryption scheme. It is
                computationally efficient and the signatures are short. The scheme’s security is proven in the standard
                model and rests on the hardness of the computational Diffie-Hellman problem in groups equipped with a
                pairing.
