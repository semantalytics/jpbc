                Radio frequency identification (RFID) chips have been widely deployed in
                large-scale systems such as inventory control and supply chain management.
                While RFID technology has much advantage, however it may create new
                problems to privacy. Tag untraceability is a significant concern that
                needs to be addressed in deploying RFID-based system.

                Our construction is the first construction in the symmetric bilinear
                setting based on a mild assumption.
                That is our assumption is tautological in the generic group model
                and is ''efficiently falsifiable'' in the sense that its problem
                instances are stated non-interactively and concisely (i.e., independently
                of the number of adversarial queries and other large quantities).
