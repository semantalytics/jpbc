            Predicate encryption schemes are encryption schemes in which
            each ciphertext Ct is associated with a binary attribute vector
            x = (x1 , . . . , xn ) and keys K are associated with predicates. A key K can
            decrypt a ciphertext Ct if and only if the attribute vector of the cipher-
            text satisfies the predicate of the key. Predicate encryption schemes can
            be used to implement fine-grained access control on encrypted data and
            to perform search on encrypted data.
            Hidden vector encryption schemes [Boneh and Waters – TCC 2007] are
            encryption schemes in which each ciphertext Ct is associated with a bi-
            nary vector x = (x1 , . . . , xn ) and each key K is associated with binary
            vector y = (y1 , · · · , yn ) with “don’t care” entries (denoted with ). Key
            K can decrypt ciphertext Ct if and only if x and y agree for all i for
            which yi = .
            Hidden vector encryption schemes are an important type of predicate
            encryption schemes as they can be used to construct more sophisticated
            predicate encryption schemes (supporting for example range and subset
            queries).
            We give a construction for hidden-vector encryption from standard com-
            plexity assumptions on bilinear groups of prime order. Previous con-
            structions were in bilinear groups of composite order and thus resulted
            in less efficient schemes. Our construction is both payload-hiding and
            attribute-hiding meaning that also the privacy of the attribute vector,
            besides privacy of the cleartext, is guaranteed.
